# 👋 Hi, I'm Giovanni Ruocco

I'm a front-end developer in the making, with a passion for UI design and creating clean, intuitive interfaces.

## 🧠 About Me

💻 I'm a **self-taught developer** with a strong motivation to learn and improve. 

🎓 I studied for two years at **École 42 (Paris/Lyon)** where I explored algorithms in C, system administration, and web development. I sharpened my front-end skills with a Master’s program at **Start2Impact**, working on real-world projects using modern tools and frameworks.

🎨 With an academic background in **psychology**, I bring a user-centered mindset to every interface. I love good design, clean typography, and digital experiences that just *feel right*.

🌱 I’m currently looking for my **first professional experience** as a front-end developer to grow within a team, contribute with curiosity and dedication, and continue learning every day.
